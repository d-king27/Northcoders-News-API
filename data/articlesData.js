That's a fun fact I'd probably never had known or maybe don't even really need to know, but now I do, thanks to Julia Rothman's Food Anatomy: The Curious Parts & Pieces of Our Edible World. Rothman has an entire series of illustrated Anatomy books, including Nature and Farm, packed with infographics, quirky facts, and maps that you can get lost in for hours—in a fun way, not in a boring textbook way. It makes you wonder why textbooks aren't this fun to read. Can someone look into this? Thanks.",

Imagine a world where presenting a platter of seasonal vegetables inspires the same amount of cooing that the turkey does. Welcome to the world of twice-baked butternut squash. Sure, you could just roast some squash wedges and call it a day. But where's the fun in that? To make this year's most impressive vegetable side, Epi's food director Rhoda Boone gave super-seasonal butternut squash the twice-baked potatoes treatment: Mash the inside of the vegetable with butter, cream, and anything else that might make it more delicious, then pile it back into the vegetable, bake it until golden and velvety. The result is a jaw-dropping, brightly colored sweet-meet-savory butternut squash side dish. Here are just a few more reasons this creation belongs on this year's Thanksgiving table:",

Appearing at the recent Node Community Convention in San Francisco, project founder Adam Baldwin, chief security officer at Web consulting company &yet, emphasized risks, protections, and progress. Baldwin sees four risks within the Node ecosystem pertinent to the enterprise: the code dependency tree, bugs, malicious actors, and people. I think of [the dependency tree] more as the dependency iceberg, to be honest, Baldwin said, where your code is the ship and your dependencies that you have with your packaged JSON is that little tiny iceberg at the top. But developers need to be aware of the massive iceberg underneath, he stressed.",
